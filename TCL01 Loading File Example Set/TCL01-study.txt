study	CMCP	Cell Line WES	TCL01	Whole exome sequencing analysis of canine cancer cell lines	"Cancer cell lines have been used for drug sensitivity assays in cancer research for decades. Recent sequencing analyses have shown that mutational profiles of human cancer cell lines often correlate with oncogene addiction and drug sensitivity. To identify somatic variants that contribute to pathogenesis and therapeutic sensitivity, this study analyzed whole exome sequencing of 33 established cancer cell lines from 10 cancer types. The study results identified 61 candidate cancer drivers across 30 cell lines. The most frequently mutated cancer driver was TP53 with 15 mutations in 12 cell lines. Additionally, 12 cell lines were sensitive to MEK1/2 inhibitor, trametinib, and exhibited constitutive or serum-activated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and 8 carried MAPK pathway cancer driver variants in NF1, BRAF, N/KRAS genes."
